# Spring_Core_Practice
"This repository contains a focused collection of Spring Core concepts and practical implementations, aimed at building a solid understanding of the core Spring Framework without using Spring Boot. It covers fundamental principles such as Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), bean configuration, and lifecycle management.

Through simple, hands-on examples using XML, annotation-based, and Java-based configurations, the repository demonstrates how to build loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable Java applications using pure Spring Core, forming a strong foundation for enterprise application development."
